> ## Summary
Computer has always been interesting subject for me. Since childhood I wanted to know whats happening "behind the curtains", so when I grow up, I discovered programming. My main goal is to receive education, understand how things work and help other people with my knowledge. My favorite part of learning programming is that there is vast information in internet, so I can learn with videos, books, podcasts. Chat with people with the same interests. Many method is available to study - you just need to start taking actions. I like learning subjects on my own - it gives me more happy emotions.
